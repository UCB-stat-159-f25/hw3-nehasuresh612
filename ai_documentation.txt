## Query 1
can you help me find the error in this code error: subprocess-exited-with-error

That's a frustrating error! This traceback is very common when you're using setuptools with dynamic configuration via pyproject.toml, specifically when trying to read the version from a file.

The core error is right at the end of the traceback:

ModuleNotFoundError: ligotools

This means that when pip and setuptools try to run the build process, they try to find and import the module ligotools to get the value of __version__ for the line:

Ini, TOML

version = {attr = "ligotools.__version__"}
